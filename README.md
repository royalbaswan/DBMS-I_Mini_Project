                                                  IPL Match Bidding App 
 
Pie-in-the-Sky, is a mobile app that is used for bidding for IPL matches legally. Anyregistered user can bid for any of the IPL matches listed in it. New users or the bidders need to register themselves into the appby providing their mobile phone number, email id and a password.Admin will maintain the match roster and keep updating other details in the system. 
The app shows the match details which includes the playing team, the venue of the match and current standing of the teams on the points table. It will display the winner at the end of the match and update the team standings in the tournament and bidder points table. System will send updates to the bidders whenever required. It will also generate the bidders' leader board. 

**App functionalities:**
* Predict Winner 
The app allows the user to predict the winner of the match before toss happens for the match on which the user is predicting. This is dynamic as the matches can have different start time. Start time will also be influenced by disruptions like rains and other unforeseen circumstances. User will not be able to see what others users have predicted. Users can change theteam bids only till the toss happens. Once the toss happens everything freezes for that match. 
* Point System
For every win, users get points. There are no negative points, meaning if the user loses the bid, he or she does not lose his/her points. Point system is very dynamic.  
At the start of the tournament when every team is at zero points, every user who wins the prediction, wins 2 points.
If the difference in the points between two teams playing, is <= 6,but >0, then the person who predicts: 
- Team with higher points will win, gets 2 points
- Team with lower points will win, gets 3 points 
If the difference in the points between two teams playing is > 6 , then the person who predicts: 
- Team with higher points will win, gets 2 points  
- Team with lower points will win, gets 5 points
